    Keep sensitive data generated by Porter safe and sound with the new secret plugin protocol
---

As part of the v1 hardening process, we have been hard at work making sure any sensitive data generated by Porter is stored in a secure location.
Therefore we have updated our secret plugin protocol to enable Porter to persist sensitive data in a secret plugin store instead of Porter's storage database.

Previously Porter only uses plugins for retrieving secrets from a secret store, and for storing its data in a Mongo database. If a sensitive data, such as a database connection string, were populated during a Porter execution, it would be stored in the Mongo database in plain text, which could lead to potential data breach.
Now Porter requires user to configure a secret store to store any data that has been flaged as sensitive in a bundle through the new plugin protocol.

Let's walk through how to update your configuration file and pick a secret plugin that works best for your usecase.

```yaml
# ~/.porter/config.toml
default-secrets- = "mysecret"

secrets:
  name = "mysecrets"
  plugin = "filesystem"
```

In the example above we configured Porter to use the [filesystem](https://release-v1.porter.sh/plugins/filesystem/) plugin, it resolves and stores sensitive bundle parameters and outpus as plaintext files in your PORTER_HOME directory.

We can replace those hard-coded values with templates, using `${env.NAME}` to insert an environment variable and `${secret.KEY}` to resolve a secret from your default secret store. Below is the final, secret-free version of the same config file:

```toml
# ~/.porter/config.toml
default-storage = "mydb"

[[storage]]
  name = "mydb"
  plugin = "mongodb"

  [[storage.config]]
    url = "${secret.porter-connection-string}"

[[secrets]]
  name = "mysecrets"
  plugin = "azure.keyvault"
  
  [[secrets.config]]
    vault = "myvault"
    subscription-id = "${env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
```

Porter takes two passes over the configuration file: first replacing environment variables, and then resolving any secrets used in the config file with the secrets plugin.

You may have noticed that this is a different template syntax than what is used in porter.yaml.
In an upcoming release, Porter's template syntax will get a similar refresh, so that the templating language is the same for both Porter's manifest and its configuration file.

Install the [latest v1 prerelease](https://github.com/getporter/porter/releases?q=v1.0.0) and make your config files secret-free! ðŸ•Š
